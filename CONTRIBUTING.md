#### License Check Failure

Run `licence-check` locally:

```sh
pnpx license-check --summary
pnpx license-check > licenses.txt
```

If the license for a package merely has a spelling or formatting difference from an existing entry in the `license-check` GitHub workflow allow list, update the list and submit the change via pull request. Otherwise, create an issue to receive further guidance from the maintainers.
